# Zelda and the Zombies

Welcome to Zelda adventures.

You wake up in Zelda land. Realizing you are the lone survivor to a deadly virus and you are surrounded by zombies. Zelda remembers the words of his master. He said, "It would take years for any mortal man to kill those zombies".

tl;dr: Kill any 1 NPC to get the flag.

Flag: `REVOLUTIONSTARTSWITHME`

Solution
========

- Use cheatengine to track HPs of NPC's. Every time you hit an NPC it loses 5 hp. This way you can easily scan for its memory address.
- Set value of HP to -1. 
- Hit zombie once more and flag will appear on the screen. 

# Zelda at the Swamp

Zelda realized that he could not only fight on land but on waters as well.

Head to FlagTown and cross the pond to get to the flag!

Flag: `EXPLORERFORLIFE`

Solution
========

Again a couple of ways to solve this. Either you can do is systematically: 
- Use cheatengine to track x,y coordinates of the player.
- Write LUA CheatEngine script to update x,y values so as to scan the entire map. 

or you can also use Cheat Engine's speed hack and try to cross through all obstacles.
